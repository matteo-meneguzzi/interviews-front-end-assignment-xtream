## 1. Project Structure

### Decision

We decided to use a modular structure with separate directories for components, hooks, services, store, and utilities.

### Rationale

This structure promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability. It makes it easier to navigate the project and locate specific functionalities.

## 2. Technology Choices

### Decision

We questioned whether to use third-party libraries and decided to do so.

### Rationale

We decided to use third-party libraries due to the short development time available and because these libraries are widely used and trusted within the community. Leveraging these libraries allows us to implement robust solutions more quickly and with less effort.

### Decision

We chose React with TypeScript for this project.

### Rationale

React is a widely adopted library for building user interfaces, known for its component-based architecture. TypeScript provides static typing, which helps catch errors early and improves code quality.

## 3. State Management

### Decision

We opted to use Redux for state management.

### Rationale

Redux provides a predictable state container that helps manage the application state, especially in large applications with complex state interactions.

## 4. API Integration

### Decision

We decided to use Axios for making HTTP requests.

### Rationale

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client with a simple API, making it easier to handle HTTP requests and responses compared to the native `fetch` API. It also offers features such as interceptors, request cancellation, and automatic JSON data transformation, which simplifies API integration and error handling.

## 5. Routing

### Decision

We decided to use React Router for client-side routing.

### Rationale

React Router is a powerful and flexible routing library for React applications. It allows for dynamic routing, nested routes, and route parameters, making it easier to manage navigation and URL structure in a single-page application. Its declarative API integrates well with React's component-based architecture, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## 6. Styling

### Decision

We decided to use Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Rationale

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that offers a low-level utility classes approach to styling. It allows for rapid prototyping and development with consistent and maintainable styles across the application. Tailwind CSS also provides excellent documentation and community support, making it a suitable choice for this project.

## 7. Testing

### Decision

We decided to use Jest and React Testing Library for testing.

### Rationale

Jest is a powerful testing framework with a great ecosystem, and React Testing Library focuses on testing components in a way that resembles how users interact with them.

## 8. Linting and Formatting

### Decision

We integrated ESLint and Prettier for linting and code formatting.

### Rationale

ESLint helps catch potential issues and enforce coding standards, while Prettier ensures consistent code formatting. Using both tools together helps maintain a clean and readable codebase.
